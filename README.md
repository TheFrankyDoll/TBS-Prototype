# TBS-Prototype
Turn-based strategy game prototype, where all gameplay calculation would be done on server.

## Structure

Server objects are made as children of client ones, and since inheritance implies concealment, the client will not have access to the server data, but the server will have it all.

This test task was made without any frameworks, but could easily be adapted for [Mirror](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror).
